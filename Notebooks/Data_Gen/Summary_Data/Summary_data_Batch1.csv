**Junior1:** Good morning, Manager. Yesterday, I completed the task of designing the user interface for the new web application. I also started working on the task of developing the back-end for the application.

**Junior2:** Good morning, Manager. Yesterday, I completed the task of setting up the development environment for the new web application. I also started working on the task of developing the front-end for the application.

**Manager:** That's great progress, both of you. Are there any blockers or challenges that you're facing?

**Junior1:** I'm having some trouble understanding the requirements for the back-end. I'm not sure how to implement some of the features that the client has requested.

**Manager:** I see. I'll schedule a meeting with the client to get some more clarification on the requirements. In the meantime, you can continue working on the other tasks that you're assigned to.

**Junior2:** I'm not having any blockers at the moment. I'm making good progress on the front-end development.

**Manager:** That's good to hear. Keep up the good work.

**Junior1:** Thank you, Manager.

**Junior2:** Thank you, Manager.

**Manager:** That's all for today's standup meeting. Keep up the good work, and let me know if you have any questions or concerns.""

**Junior 1**: Sure. Yesterday, I completed the data extraction process and loaded the data into the staging area. Today, I'm working on data validation and removing any duplicate or incomplete records.

**Manager**: Great work. What about you, Junior 2?

**Junior 2**: I've been working on developing the data cleaning scripts. I've completed the scripts for removing duplicate records and replacing missing values with default values. Today, I'll be working on the scripts for handling outliers and inconsistent data formats.

**Manager**: Excellent. And Junior 3, what's your status?

**Junior 3**: I've been focusing on data profiling and analysis. I've identified several data quality issues, such as missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data formats. I've also created a data quality report that summarizes the issues and provides recommendations for resolving them.

**Manager**: Thank you, everyone. You're all making great progress. Are there any blockers or challenges you're facing?

**Junior 1**: I'm having some trouble handling the large volume of data. The data cleaning process is taking longer than expected.

**Manager**: I see. We can allocate additional resources to help you with the data processing. Let me know if you need any assistance.

**Junior 2**: I'm facing some challenges in handling inconsistent data formats. Some of the data fields have different formats, which makes it difficult to clean and standardize the data.

**Manager**: That's a valid concern. We can consider using data transformation tools or libraries to help you convert the data into a consistent format.

**Junior 3**: I'm facing a blocker with data access. I need to access some sensitive data that requires additional authorization.

**Manager**: I'll follow up with the data security team to expedite the authorization process.

**Manager**: Overall, you're all doing a fantastic job. Keep up the good work. If you encounter any further challenges, don't hesitate to reach out for support. We're here to help you succeed.
