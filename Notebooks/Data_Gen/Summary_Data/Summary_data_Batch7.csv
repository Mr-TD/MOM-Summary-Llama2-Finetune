**Junior 2:** Thanks.

**Manager:** Any other questions or concerns?

**Junior 1:** No, that's all from me.

**Junior 2:** I have a question about the logging configuration.

**Manager:** Sure, go ahead.

**Junior 2:** In the logs, I'm seeing a lot of duplicate entries. Is there a way to filter out these duplicates?

**Manager:** Yes, you can use the `logger.remove()` method to remove duplicate logs. Just make sure to apply the filter before you start logging.

**Junior 2:** Okay, I'll try that. Thanks.

**Junior 3:** I'm a bit concerned about the timeline for the project. With the data integration issue, I'm worried that we may fall behind schedule.

**Manager:** Yes, that's a valid concern. Let's discuss how we can mitigate the risk and ensure we stay on track.

**[Team discusses strategies for addressing the timeline concern and any potential blockers.]**

**Manager:** That should cover it for today. Keep up the good work, team. Let me know if you have any questions or need anything.""

**Junior 1:** I've completed cleaning the data for the customer segmentation analysis. I'm currently working on creating the visualization for the report.

**Manager:** Great, keep up the good work. Junior 2, what have you been working on?

**Manager:** Okay, make sure to address those outliers carefully. Junior 3, what's your status?

**Junior 3:** I've completed the data cleaning for the product recommendation engine. However, I've identified a potential blocker. The data format for user preferences is inconsistent, which may affect the accuracy of the recommendations.

**Manager:** Thank you for bringing that up. We need to find a solution for that. Junior 4, what have you been up to?

**Junior 4:** I've been working on cleaning the data for the churn prediction model. I've completed the initial cleaning and started exploring the data for feature engineering.

**Manager:** Excellent. It seems like we're making good progress on all fronts. Are there any other updates or concerns?

**Junior 2:** I have a question about the data normalization process. Should we use min-max scaling or standard scaling?

**Manager:** That's a good question. Let's discuss the pros and cons of each approach and decide in our next meeting. For now, continue with standard scaling.

**Manager:** Alright team, thank you for your updates. Let's keep up the momentum and work together to complete this project successfully.
