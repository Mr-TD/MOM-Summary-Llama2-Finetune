**Manager:** Great work, Junior1. Junior2, what's your status?

**Junior2:** Hello. I finished cleaning the sales transaction data last night. Currently, I'm working on cleaning the customer feedback data. I'm encountering some issues with inconsistent data formats, but I'm working through them.

**Manager:** Okay, Junior2. Keep me updated on any progress. Junior3, over to you.

**Junior3:** Hi. I've been working on the data cleaning for the social media engagement data. I've identified some duplicate entries that I'm currently removing. I'm also exploring the use of natural language processing (NLP) tools to automate some of the data cleaning tasks.

**Manager:** That's great to hear, Junior3. I encourage you to continue investigating the NLP tools. They can potentially save us a lot of time. Are there any blockers or challenges we need to address?

**Junior1:** I have a quick question about the data cleaning standards. Should we be removing all outliers or only the most extreme ones?

**Manager:** Thanks for bringing that up, Junior1. We should only remove outliers that significantly distort the data. We want to preserve as much data as possible while still ensuring the accuracy of our analysis.

**Junior2:** Okay, that makes sense. I'll adjust my data cleaning process accordingly.

**Manager:** Perfect. Well, it sounds like everyone is making good progress. Keep up the great work and let me know if you have any further questions or need any support. Meeting adjourned.""
