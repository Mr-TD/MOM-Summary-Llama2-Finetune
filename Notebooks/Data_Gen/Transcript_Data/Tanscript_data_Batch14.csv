`**Manager:** Good morning, team. Let's start our daily standup.

**Junior 1:** Yesterday, I completed cleaning the 'customers' table and started working on the 'orders' table. I found some duplicate records that need to be removed.

**Manager:** Great work. Make sure to document the duplicate records for future reference.

**Junior 2:** I completed cleaning the 'products' table and created a new column to store product categories.

**Manager:** That's excellent. Product categories will be useful for our analysis later on.

**Junior 3:** I encountered a blocker while cleaning the 'transactions' table. There are some missing values in the 'amount' column.

**Manager:** I see. Can you send me the details of the missing values? I'll reach out to the data team to get them filled in.

**Junior 3:** Yes, I'll do that.

**Manager:** Any other updates or questions?

*Silence*

**Manager:** Alright, team. Keep up the good work. Let's continue with our tasks and address any blockers as they arise. Have a productive day!`
