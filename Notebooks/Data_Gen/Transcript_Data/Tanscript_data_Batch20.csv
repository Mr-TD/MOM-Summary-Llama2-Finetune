""**Manager:** Good morning team. Let's get started with our daily standup meeting.

**Junior 1:** Good morning. Yesterday, I completed the design for the user interface. Today, I'm working on implementing the backend functionality.

**Junior 2:** Good morning. I finished developing the database schema. I'm currently writing the code to populate the database.

**Junior 3:** Good morning. I encountered a blocker yesterday while trying to integrate the payment gateway. I'm researching potential solutions.

**Junior 4:** Good morning. I've been working on the unit tests for the frontend. I'm making good progress, but I have a question about the test coverage requirements.

**Manager:** Thank you for the updates. Junior 3, can you provide more details about the blocker you encountered?

**Junior 3:** Sure. The payment gateway provider requires additional security measures that we haven't implemented yet. I'm looking into how to add those measures without impacting the user experience.

**Manager:** Okay, let me know if you need any assistance. Junior 4, I'll follow up with you on the test coverage requirements.

**Junior 4:** Thank you.

**Manager:** Is there anything else that anyone would like to share?

**Junior 3:** I've completed the data validation for the first dataset. Today, I'm working on developing the data dictionary and creating the metadata for the cleaned data.

**Junior 4:** I've encountered a blocker while working on the data transformation. The data mapping rules are unclear, and I need some guidance from the team to proceed.

**Junior 4:** Thank you, manager.

**Manager:** Are there any other questions or concerns?

**Junior 3:** I have a question about the data dictionary. Should we include the technical metadata, such as data types and field lengths, or just focus on the business metadata?

**Manager:** That's a good question. I think it would be helpful to include both the technical and business metadata. This will make it easier for the downstream users to understand the data structure and its meaning.
