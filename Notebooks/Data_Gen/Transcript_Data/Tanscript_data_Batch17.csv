**Junior 1:** Hi everyone. Yesterday, I completed the data cleaning and preprocessing tasks. I'm currently working on building the machine learning model. I've encountered a blocker with the feature scaling, but I'm working on it.

**Junior 2:** Hi team. I finished the data visualization dashboard. I'm now working on integrating it with the front-end application. I don't have any blockers at the moment.

**Manager:** Great work, team. I'm glad to see that you're making good progress. Junior 1, can you give us an update on your blocking issue?

**Junior 1:** I'm trying to scale the features using the StandardScaler, but I'm getting an error. I've checked the documentation and tried different settings, but I can't seem to fix it.

**Manager:** I see. I'll take a look at it after the meeting. In the meantime, try using a different scaling method, such as MinMaxScaler or RobustScaler.

**Junior 1:** Okay, I'll give that a try. Thanks.

**Manager:** That's it for today's standup. Keep up the good work, and let me know if you have any other questions. Thanks.""
